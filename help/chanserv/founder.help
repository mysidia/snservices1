      /ChanServ HELP LEVELS

     ACCESS:
      Operators of level founder have full control of the channel
      op list, they can additionally set channel modelocks,
      restrict, topiclock levels, and all channel options
      except the channel password.

      While this level has access equivalent to that of the
      founder, operators given this access are not considered
      to be owners of the channel -- ownership of the channel
      is established only by knowledge of the password.

     EXAMPLES:
     To grant Joe level 15 (Founder) op status on #sorcery
       /msg ChanServ founder #sorcery add Joe
