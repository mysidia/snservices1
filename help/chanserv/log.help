 === LOG ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ LOG <message>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     This command allows an operator to write a message to services logs to
     annotate other logged commands.

     It should be used when a command is used in an unusual way, or when an
     oper is likely to need information about a channel's situation in handling
     future requests.
     
 
     EXAMPLES:  
       /CS LOG #Foo was closed due to services abuse
       /CS LOG #Xyz /cs deleted by founder request, not abuse
