  === CLEAN ===

     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ clean <#channel> 
  
     DESCRIPTION:
     In order to stop people taking over channels by registering expired
     nicks, when a nick expires, all the ops list entries for it are marked
     as deactivated. This command searches through the ops list and removes
     all nicks that are marked as deactivated. Deactivated nicks must be
     readded by the founder in order to re-enable them. In the case of the
     founders nick, then the founder needs to id to the channel with the
     founders password.
  
     EXAMPLES:
     Clean the ops list for #sorcery.
     /ChanServ CLEAN #sorcery
