 === GS_ROLL ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ Set #<channel> Gs_Roll <on | off>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     Normally use of GameServ on a channel is restricted
     so that only people listed in the ChanServ access list
     may use the roll command.

     If this option is enabled, then people you set voice, or
     op (+v or +o) in the channel may use GameServ,
 
     Even if they do not have ChanServ access.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     /ChanServ set #rpg gs_roll on
     /ChanServ set #sorcery gs_roll off
 
     Limited to Founder Access
