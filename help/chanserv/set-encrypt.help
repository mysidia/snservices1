 === ENCRYPT ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ SET #<channel> ENCRYPT <ENCRYPT | UNENCRYPT>  <password>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     This command controls how the password information is stored for 
     your channel in services' database.

     Currently when OFF, your channel's password is stored as plaintext,
     when set ON, your channel's password is stored with one way encryption:
     the original password cannot be computed from what is stored in the database.

     The option is set 'ENCRYPT' by default for new channels: which indicates
     the MD5 message digest of passwords is stored.

     SHA1 encryption and authentication for nicks and channels is not yet available.
     When it becomes available, you will need to change this option to SHA1 
     in order to use IDENTIFY-SHA1.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To switch to encryption, use:
       /ChanServ set #Dark ENCRYPT ON
