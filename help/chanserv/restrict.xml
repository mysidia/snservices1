     RESTRICT is used to set a minimum access level for which
     nicks can join the channel.  If a nick attempts to
     join a level restricted channel for which their access
     level is NOT high enough then they will be auto-kicked 
     and banned from the channel.
     For a list of access levels <b>/ChanServ help LEVELS</b>
