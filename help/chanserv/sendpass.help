  === SENDPASS ===
   
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ sendpass <#channel> [-new|-resend|-transfer] 
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     This is the replacement of the old getpass command. It has 3 modes of
     operation.
 
     -new - Send a password change authorisation code to the registered
     email
 
     -resend - Resend a password change authorisation code to the registered
     email
 
     -transfer - Disables the channel password and sends the GRPop
     a password change code enabling them to confiscate the channel or
     return ownership to the proper user.
 
     Use of the sendpass command destroys the current password, replacing it
     with a tempoary authorisation code. Once the code is recieved, a new
     password is installed with the SETPASS command.

     EXAMPLES:
     The founder of #here lost his password. Use -new to set a tempoary
     password, so the founder can set a new password.
     /ChanServ SENDPASS #here -new 
  
     The founder of #here lost his password, and has already been sent an
     authorisation code. Use -resend to resend the code.
     /ChanServ SENDPASS #here -resend
