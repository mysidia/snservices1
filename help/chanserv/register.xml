     REGISTER allows a user to "own" a channel.  Registering 
     your channel makes it almost impossible for anyone to
     take over your channel, eliminating the need for bots.
     The founder registers the channel with a password, then 
     he or she can change the channel settings, and add 
     Operators of different access levels. It is important
     to note that <b>PaSsWoRdS aRe CaSe SeNsItIvE</b>,
     and Channel registrations are limited to 10 per user.
