 === AKICKREASONS ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ Set #<channel> Akickreasons <on | off>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     Normally akick reasons are visible to channel operators only.

     However, if you enable this op reason, then every time ChanServ
     kicks a user due to an akick, it will display the full reason.

     Note that a current side effect of this is that the nickname
     the channel operator who set the akick will appear in the kick reason.

 
     EXAMPLES:
     /ChanServ set #services akickreasons on
