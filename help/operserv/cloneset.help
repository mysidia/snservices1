 === CLONESET ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /OperServ CLONESET <host> <ignore/-ignore/kill/-kill>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     The CLONESET command allows you to set how OperServ reacts
     to clones. OperServ will ignore all clones from a host when
     IGNORE is set. If KILL is the command set, OperServ will
     automaticly kill any clone that triggers the clone alert.

     type:

     To remove the clone ignore from flame.org, type:

     the clone alert, type:
