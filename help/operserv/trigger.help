 === TRIGGER ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /OperServ TRIGGER <user@host> <#>
     /OperServ TRIGGER list
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     The TRIGGER command allows you to set the number of clones 
     which can be connected from one host before OperServ begins
     to issue clone warnings. This command can only be set while
     the hostname in question is connected and sets back to default
     when the last connection for this host is terminated.

     To set the trigger for the host luthien@ts1-p6.auracom.com to 
     5, type:
       /OperServ trigger luthien@ts1-p6.auracom.com 5
