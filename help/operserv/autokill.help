     or remove an autokill from the network wide ban list.  The 
     time field is always in hours.  If - is used in the time 
     field, the autokill is removed, if a 0 is used the autokill 
     is permanent.

           If the '-r <reason>' option is given, autokills whose reason matches
           the given pattern will be listed.
