 === RELEASE ===
      
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ RELEASE <nickname> <password>
  
     DESCRIPTION:
     RELEASE removes a NickServ enforcer, allowing you to use
     your nickname.  NickServ enforcers are created when 
     someone who does not know your password or is not on your
     access list attempts to use your nickname while the KILL 
     option is set ON.  If you are not on your nickname's access
     list, you must include your password.
   
     EXAMPLES:
     To remove a NickServ enforcer holding the nick Raistlin,
     with your current user@host mask in your access list:
       /NickServ release Raistlin
     To remove a NickServ enforcer holding the nick Raistlin,
     with the password fizzle:
       /NickServ release Raistlin fizzle
