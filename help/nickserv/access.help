     DESCRIPTION:
     The NickServ ACCESS command has two uses.  Its first use

     second use is to manipulate your NickServ access list.
     ACCESS ADD is used to add user@host entries to your access 
     list.  ACCESS DEL is used to remove entries from your access
     list.  ACCESS LIST is used to list current entries in your
     access list.

     To delete raistlin@*.sorcery.net from the access list of your
     current nick:
       /NickServ access del raistlin@*.sorcery.net
