 === IDENTIFY ===
  
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ IDENTIFY-MD5
     /NickServ IDENTIFY-MD5 [<nick>] <hash>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     This command is mostly for use by automated scripts, and is not
     a very effective or easy command for manual use.

     By itself this command requests a cookie for authentication.

     Otherwise, a md5 hash is expected that is formed from:
                   <nick>:<cookie>:<md5-hashed version of password>
