					to IRC and not part of the original IRC
					protocol.

					The addon provides registration services
					for user nicknames and channels on IRC,
					and it provides additional tools to help
					administrators see and take action against
					abuses of their server and enforce
					their policies.
				</P

>					The addon is implemented as a pseudo-server.

					That is, under normal operation, services exists
					as a server node in the IRC network and provides
					its services under the pseudonym of "fake" user nodes
					on the network who are used when any request
					needs to be made of services and who are used
					to return the results of the request to the user
					who made it.
				</P
><P
>					So services is not truly an IRC server or
					part of IRC itself, nor are the "services users"
					really users, but to the network they appear as such, and the
					basic IRC commands for interacting with services
					are the same as those for interacting with
					an ordinary IRC Robot (or user).

>					Requests to services are sent over IRC's

					facility, and services' answer to a
					request is returned in the form of
					a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>private notice</I
></SPAN
>.
				</P
><P
>					Although the services package allows an
					administrator of services to name the
					services units however they like, the
					typical names of the services provided
					by the sorserv addon are:
