				<para>
					The purpose of this document is to
					aid in the installation of the services
					software.
				</para>

				<para>
					This is not an introduction to IRC.

					The reader is assumed to already be
					familiar with IRC.  Prior to installing
					and configuring services, it is necessary
					at the very least to know how to install,
					use, and administer IRC servers based
					on or similar to sorircd.
				</para>

				<para>
					Services is known to run on the
					following platforms:
					<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Linux</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>NetBSD</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>

					Services may also run on similar
					operating systems, but if a platform
					is not listed above, then services
					may not run on it, so expect to have
					problems if you are attempting to
					install on an unsupported platform.
				</para>

				<para>
					Basic skills in the use of the
					operating system that you will run
					services on and IRC itself is assumed.
					Extensive knowledge of your operating
					system, development tools, and services
					may be required if you are attempting to
					install on a target not shown above.

			<title>Overview</title>

				<para>
					Sorserv (IRC Services) is an IRC addon,
					that is, it is an <emphasis>extension</emphasis>
					to IRC and not part of the original IRC
					protocol.

					The addon provides registration services
					for user nicknames and channels on IRC,
					and it provides additional tools to help
					administrators see and take action against
					abuses of their server and enforce
					their policies.
				</para>
	
				<para>
					The addon is implemented as a pseudo-server.

					That is, under normal operation, services exists
					as a server node in the IRC network and provides
					its services under the pseudonym of "fake" user nodes
					on the network who are used when any request
					needs to be made of services and who are used
					to return the results of the request to the user
					who made it.
				</para>

				<para>
					So services is not truly an IRC server or
					part of IRC itself, nor are the "services users"
					really users, but to the network they appear as such, and the
					basic IRC commands for interacting with services
					are the same as those for interacting with
					an ordinary IRC Robot (or user).
				</para>

				<para>
					Requests to services are sent over IRC's
					<emphasis>private message</emphasis>
					facility, and services' answer to a
					request is returned in the form of
					a <emphasis>private notice</emphasis>.
				</para>

				<para>
					Although the services package allows an
					administrator of services to name the
					services units however they like, the
					typical names of the services provided
					by the sorserv addon are:
					<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>OperServ</para>
						<para>
							Handles most
							administrative requests,
							and it is an interface
							usable only by global
							operators of the IRC
							system.
						</para>
						</listitem>

					<listitem><para>NickServ</para>
						<para>
							Has the domain of

					<listitem><para>ChanServ</para>
						<para>

				<listitem><para>
					Add a U-line and a H-line for services

					Be certain the U-line and H-lines are added <emphasis>before</emphasis>
					starting services, or you will need to restart
					services after adding the lines (and doing a server /rehash)
					for changes to take effect.

					<programlisting>
		U:services.hostname_here.net:*:*

			</para>

			<para>
				After services have been installed, in
				this manner, you should be able to start
				them by running the binary.
				If the IRC server is running and both
				services and your IRC server are properly
				configured, services will then activate.

				However, if you have been installing
				services using administrative access
				on your machine,
				<emphasis>
					stop now
				</emphasis>, make a separate services
				account, and ensure that the databases
				and database directories where the
				logfiles will be written are all owned
				by that account.

				Never run services as root for any reason.
			</para>

			<para>
				To gain administrative access within
				services during the first services session,
				start services, register your nickname with
				NickServ, add a line that reads 'SRA:nickname_here'
				to your services.conf file, and finally,
				restart services.

				Once you have administrative access, new
				configuration options can be added and
				helpfiles can be updated with the
				<emphasis>/OperServ reset</emphasis> command.
			</para>

			<para>
				Once services start, and you are able
				to interact with services, the installation
				is completed.

				It is, however, a good idea to test
				services functions that required special
				actions on your part to work properly:

				Test to ensure that requests such as
				<emphasis>/NickServ HELP</emphasis>
				work (if it fails, you may not have installed
				the helpfiles properly, see <xref linkend="install" />.), and register sample nicks, channels,
				memos, triggers, and restart services to
				ensure all databases are being written:
				if they are not, ensure that the permissions
				on the files and directories allow the services
				user full access to those files.
			</para>

			<para>
				If services fail to start, <emphasis>core.log</emphasis>,
				and notices sent to +s users on the IRC server you
				were trying to connect services to are good places to start looking
				for information on why the startup failed.

			<title>About services.conf</title>
			<para>
			Services.conf is the file used to set
			certain parameters and variables, particularly
			limits and startup settings that are global to services.
			</para>

			<para>
			A services.conf configuration file is viewed
			by services as a series of directives to be
			executed as the file is being read, and each
			line is a single directive.
			</para>

			<para>
			A directive which takes a single line consists of
			a special <emphasis>word</emphasis> that services
			knows to represent a certain kind of directive,
			followed by a colon, and then a parameter for
			the directive.
			</para>

			<para>
			Any line beginning with a ``#'' symbol is instead
			read as a comment (or annotation) and is ignored
			by services.

			This can also be used to comment out or temporarily disable
			a directive.

						<listitem><para>
Warning: Services root access allows a user to make any change to
services available to be made online. It is advisable to limit this
access to competent operators and developers who are familiar with the internals
of services: giving this permission flag to services can be thought of as
giving a user on a unix system limited superuser access (and access to
the services account analogous to full superuser access over services).
						</para></listitem>

						<listitem><para>
SRA lines should not be added for a nickname until that nickname
       is registered -- presently, this would cause a security problem
       (a user you don't want to have this access could register the nick of
        a user you want to have access and gain that access).
						</para></listitem>

 Services.conf can be reloaded to make a new SRA using the <emphasis>OperServ reset</emphasis>

						<listitem><para>
ServOp access grants many of the SRA features such as the ability
to delete nicknames, channels, perm akills, ignores, autohurts;
however, it does not grant the ability to change operator access
flags, directly modify things, shutdown services, or access
internal debugging commands.  The most useful of those abilities (other than
actually setting flags or killing services) can now be assigned using the
<emphasis>OperServ SETOP</emphasis> command and appropriate permission flags,
also.

		<title>Administering Services</title>
		<sect1 id="admin1">
			<title>Basic Administration</title>

			<para>
				Now we come to the matter of the basic
			services administrative functions.

			First of all, to perform any administration,
			you must have administrative access to services.
			See <xref linkend="install" /> for
			information on how to get services to give you
			full access.
			</para>

			<para>
			Secondly, you must be using the nickname that has
			administrative access and be fully identified with
			NickServ.  This is true of all commands that require
			special administrative access to services, including
			standard oper commands such as <emphasis>autokill</emphasis>.
			</para>

			<para>
			Certain changes to services require a restart,
			you might also need to shut down services, for
			example to reboot the host machine, hence to
			shut down services, you do:
				<emphasis>/OperServ SHUTDOWN</emphasis>
			</para>

			<para>
			Restarting services requires that you log into the
			machine and re-run the binary after invoking
			the shutdown command (normally one does a shutdown while
			already logged in -- sending the process signal 15
			will result in a clean shutdown as well).
			</para>

			<para>
			Another thing you might need to do while administering
			services is to reload the configuration file.
			To do this, you send the request: <emphasis>/OperServ reset</emphasis>
			</para>

			<para>
			The <emphasis>/OperServ RAW</emphasis> request is used to
			cause services to send RAW data over the network.

			This data is sent over a connection that the other servers recognize
			as a <emphasis>super server</emphasis> (because of the U-line), so use of this
			should be cautioned.</para>

			<para>
			The <emphasis>/OperServ UPTIME</emphasis> request can be used
			to see how long services have been running since the past
			restart.
			</para>

			<para>
			The <emphasis>/Operserv SYNC</emphasis> request can be used to
			force a complete sync of services' databases to disk which
			is very useful in running full backups.</para>

			<para>
			Finally, the <emphasis>/NickServ DELETE</emphasis> command
			can be used to cancel NickServ registrations, <emphasis>/NickServ BANISH</emphasis>
			can be used to permanently block registration and use of a nick, and ChanServ
			has equivalent commands for channels.
			</para>

			<para>
				The directive <emphasis>/OperServ HELP</emphasis>
				contains a more complete description of many requests
				(commands) used to administer services and the databases,
				that are less important to the general problem of administering
				services, for example: clonerules, autokills, autohurts,
				jupes, timers, and triggers.
			</para>
		</sect1>

		<sect1 id="admin2">
			<title>Administering Permission Flags</title>

			<para>
				The command <emphasis>/OperServ SETOP</emphasis>
				is used to administer permission flags
				of operators.
			</para>

			<para>
				There exist a number of 'flags' that allow
				access to specific services functions to be
				shared with operators.

				These permission flags can be added or
				removed individually as needed.
			</para>

			<para>
				The command <emphasis>/OperServ SETOP LIST</emphasis>
				displays a list of all operators who have been
				assigned any special permissions, and the command

                GNU Free Documentation License
                   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
