=== MODELOCK ===
    SYNTAX:
    1:  MODELOCK <channel> <mode>
      ex.  /msg ChanServ MODELOCK [=]+tn-spk

    DESCRIPTION
    MODELOCK locks the modes of a channel. The modes will remain
    set even after the last person leaves the channel.  These
    locked modes cannot be changed without the proper access
    level.  Adding a '=' to the beginning of the modelock will
    totally ignore the previous modelock, rather than the default
    behavior, which is to toggle the previous modelock's modes.
