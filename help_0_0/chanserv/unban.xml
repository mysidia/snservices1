     UNBAN ALL removes all channel bans, UNBAN by itself removes the ban
     for the person issuing the command. UNBAN only works if
     you are listed in the channel operator database of the channel you are
     attempting to use this command on.
  
     This command contains alternate syntax to ease users in transition
     to this revision of services: 'UNBAN #channel *' is the same as
     UNBAN ALL, 'UNBAN ME' and 'UNBAN &lt;your nickname&gt;' are the same as
     UNBAN by itself.
