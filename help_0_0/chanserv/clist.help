     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ clist <#channel> 
  
     DESCRIPTION:
     A command that has been availiable to IRC Operators for a long time,
     and is now availiable to channel ops. It requests that chanserv display
     who it thinks are in the channel, and is a tool for detecting desynchs.
     If chanserv's view of the channel does not match the reality, then it
     is desynched.
  
     An MKICK will cure the desynch.

     To use it, you must be at least SOP level, in the channel, or the
     channel is not +s or +p. A list of the users will appear in your status
     window, along with a number. the number indicates their "op status",
     where:
  
     0 - No ops.
  
     1 - Is a channel op.
  
     2 - Is a channel voice.

     EXAMPLES:
     To check and see if the channel #here is desynched
     /ChanServ CLIST #here
