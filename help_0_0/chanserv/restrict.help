     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ RESTRICT #<channel> <level>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     RESTRICT is used to set a minimum access level for which
     nicks can join the channel.  If a nick attempts to
     join a level restricted channel for which their access
     level is NOT high enough then they will be auto-kicked 
     and banned from the channel.
     For a list of access levels /ChanServ help LEVELS
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To restrict #Sorcery to access level 8 and above:
       /ChanServ restrict #Sorcery 8
     To remove the access level restriction from #Sorcery:
       /ChanServ restrict #Sorcery off
