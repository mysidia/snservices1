     /ChanServ MARK <#channel> [<on | off>]
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     The MARK command allows a +O operator to mark a channel; indicating

     EXAMPLES:
     Suppose you discovered Foo trying to use a devious trick to convince you
     to give him ownership of #Blah'sChan, you could issue the command:
       /CS Mark #Blah'sChan On
       /CS LOG Foo is trying to steal #Blah'sChan with devious trick XXX.
