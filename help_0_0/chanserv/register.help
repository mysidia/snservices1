 === REGISTER ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /ChanServ REGISTER #<channel> <password> <description>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     REGISTER allows a user to "own" a channel.  Registering 
     your channel makes it almost impossible for anyone to
     take over your channel, eliminating the need for bots.
     The founder registers the channel with a password, then 
     he or she can change the channel settings, and add 
     Operators of different access levels.
     PaSsWoRdS aRe CaSe SeNsItIvE
     Channel registrations are limited to 10 per user.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To register the channel #Dark with the password ShAyDe and
     the description "Where Shadows Live":
       /ChanServ register #Dark ShAyDe Where Shadows Live
