 === REGISTER ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ REGISTER <your password> <your email address>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     NickServ REGISTER allows you to 'own' your nickname on
     SorceryNet. You can then configure your nickname to your
     liking using the various NickServ features.  The email 
     address is optional, but we highly recommend that you do 
     supply it to assist us if you lose your password.  Your 
     email address will not be distributed to anyone.
 
     NOTE: If you do not USE your NickServ registration for a
     period  of 25 days or more, it is at risk of expiring. USING
     your registration means using the IDENTIFY command.  If you
     need to take a vacation and wish to avoid a nick expiration,
     see /NickServ HELP VACATION
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To register your nick with the email address
     myaddress@myaddress.com and the password fz345:
       /nickserv register fz345 myaddress@myaddress.com
     To register your nick without an email address:
       /nickserv register fz345 NONE

     Do not copy the examples: your registration will be insecure
     if the password you use can be guessed.  Use your real e-mail
     address or none, see above for more information.
  
     If you register your nickname with NONE as the email address,
     SorceryNet will not be able to help you if your password is
     lost or stolen.
