 === SET IDTIME ===

     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ SET IDTIME <time>

     DESCRIPTION:
     The NickServ SET IDTIME option lets you change
     the length of time NickServ will wait before
     changing your nickname if you fail to identify
     yourself.  The time parameter is assumed to be in
     seconds.  If no parameter is given, NickServ will
     show your current ID time.

     EXAMPLES:
     To set your ID time to 90 seconds:
       /msg NickServ set idtime 90
     To view the value of your ID time:
       /msg NickServ set idtime
