     DESCRIPTION:
     The NickServ SET ADDRESS option is used to set or change 
     your current email address.  By setting your email address,
     the SorceryNet administration can recover your password for
     your nickname or channel should you ever lose it.  Your
     email address is not visible unless you wish it to be, and 
     is not distributed to anyone.  
  
     EXAMPLES:
     To set your email address as blah@sorcery.net:
       /NickServ set address blah@sorcery.net
