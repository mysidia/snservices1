 === SENDPASS ===
    
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ <nickname> [-new|-resend|-transfer] 
    
     DESCRIPTION:
     This is the replacement of the old getpass command. It has 3 modes of
     operation.
    
     -new - Send a password change authorisation code to the registered
     email
    
     -resend - Resend a password change authorisation code to the registered
     email
  
     -transfer - Send the authorisation code to the GRPop using the
     command, enabling them to confiscate the nickname and transfer t
     it to the rightful owner.
    
     Use of the sendpass command sets a tempoary authorisation code.
     The code is used to establish a new password with the SETPASS
     command.
  
     Limited to IRC Operators
       
     EXAMPLE:
     Milambar has (oops) lost his password. Use -new to set a tempoary
     password, so the founder can set a new password.
     /NickServ SENDPASS Milambar -new 
  
     Milambar has (oops) lost his password, and has already been sent an
     authorisation code. Use -resend to resend the code.
     /NickServ SENDPASS Milambar -resend 
  
     For some extenuating circumstance, the IRC Ops decided to award the
     nick Milambar to someone else, so an IRC Op requests a code for
     himself, so that they may transfer the nickname to the new owner.
     /NickServ SENDPASS Milambar -transfer
