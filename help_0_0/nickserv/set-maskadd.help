 === SETMASKADDRESS ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ SET MASKADDRESS <on/off>
     /NickServ SET MASKADD <on/off>
   
     DESCRIPTION:
     The MASKADDRESS option, when enabled will attempt to hide
     your hostaddress from other users by setting your usermode
     +m and causing services to reveal only masked data.

     The +m usermode which can be set at any time by you with
     /mode <yournick> +m applies similar protection at the
     IRC level, causing /whois, etc to show only masked data.

     The obvious benefit of a masked host is some small degree
     of protection against some 'nuking', some 'hacking', and some
     ip-based denial of service attacks.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To turn NickServ masking on: /NickServ set maskadd on
     To turn NickServ masking off: /NickServ set maskadd off
