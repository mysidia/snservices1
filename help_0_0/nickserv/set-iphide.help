 === SET IPHIDE ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /NickServ SET IPHIDE <on/off>
   
     DESCRIPTION:
     The IPHIDE option, when enabled will attempt to hide
     your hostaddress from other users by setting your usermode
     +m and causing services to reveal only disguised information.

     This option is to provided only to attempt to bolster security,
     *NOT* as an aid to abuse, your actual hostname is only protected
     in a weak manner.

     The +m usermode which can be set at any time by you with
     /mode <yournick> +m applies similar protection at the
     IRC level, causing /whois, etc to show only masked data.

     The obvious benefit of a masked host is some small degree
     of protection against some 'nuking', some 'hacking', and some
     ip-based denial of service attacks.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To turn NickServ hiding/masking on: /NickServ set iphide on
     To turn NickServ hiding/masking off: /NickServ set iphide off
