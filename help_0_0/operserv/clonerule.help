     DESCRIPTION:
     This command edits services' persistent clone information.
     Note that this command is not just for allowing
     clones from a host but also for disallowing them.
     (required reading before creating perm triggers: 
      /operserv help ptrigger)
        
     EXAMPLE: 
     To add a persistent clone rule to allow foo.com to hold 15 clients:
     /operserv clonerule add *@foo.com
     /operserv clonerule set *@foo.com htrigger 15
     /operserv clonerule set *@foo.com utrigger 15
     /operserv clonerule set *@foo.com warnmsg Please rem the clones
     /operserv clonerule set *@foo.com killmsg none
     /operserv clonerule set *@foo.com flags ignore kill
 
     Note: this command is limited to Services Operators
