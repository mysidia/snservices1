/*
 * PATCHes
 *
 * Only put here ADDED special stuff, for instance: ".mu3" or ".ban"
 * Please start the patchlevel with a '.'
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We've copied the patch-scheme from u2.9, note the new
 * format - it isn't neccessarily to edit this manually !!!
 * If you do, be sure you know what you are doing!
 * 
 * For patch devellopers:
 * To make a diff of your patch, edit any of the below lines containing
 * a "" (an EMPTY string). Your patch will then succeed, with only an
 * offset, on the first empty place in the users patchlevel.h.
 * Do not change anyother line, the '\' are to make sure that the 'fuzz'
 * will stay 0. --Run
