 === AUTOKILL ===
 
     SYNTAX:
     /msg OperServ AUTOKILL <time/-> <nick!user@host> <reason> 
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     OperServ AUTOKILL can either give a list of current autokills
     on the network, or if you are a ServOp+, it can be used to add
     or remove an autokill from the network wide ban list.  The 
     time field is always in hours.  If - is used in the time 
     field, the autokill is removed, if a 0 is used the autokill 
     is permanent.
 
     EXAMPLES:
     To retrieve a list of autokills:
       /msg OperServ autokill
     To add an autokill for *!foo@*.bar.com for 2 hours for 
     advertising:

     SYNTAX:
     /msg OperServ CLONESET <host> <ignore/-ignore/kill/-kill>
 
     DESCRIPTION:
     The CLONESET command allows you to set how OperServ reacts
     to clones. OperServ will ignore all clones from a host when
     IGNORE is set. If KILL is the command set, OperServ will
     automaticly kill any clone that triggers the clone alert.

     EXAMPLES:
     To set OperServ to ignore all clones from the host flame.org,
     type:
       /msg OperServ cloneset flame.org ignore
     To remove the clone ignore from flame.org, type:
       /msg OperServ cloneset flame.org -ignore
     To set OperServ to kill any clone from flame.org that triggers
     the clone alert, type:

     DESCRIPTION:
     OperServ IGNORE can be used to give a list of hostmasks
     currently on the services ignore list, or if you are a 
     ServOp+, it can be used to add or remove a services
     ignore.  If - is used in the time field, the ignore is 
     removed, if a 0 is used the ignore is permanent.

     DESCRIPTION:
     This command edits services' persistent clone information.
     Note that this command is not just for allowing
     clones from a host but also for disallowing them.
     (required reading before creating perm triggers: 
      /msg operserv help ptrigger)
        
     EXAMPLE: 
     To add a persistent clone rule to allow foo.com to hold 15 clients:
     /msg operserv clonerule add *@foo.com
     /msg operserv clonerule set *@foo.com htrigger 15
     /msg operserv clonerule set *@foo.com utrigger 15
     /msg operserv clonerule set *@foo.com warnmsg Please rem the clones
     /msg operserv clonerule set *@foo.com killmsg none
     /msg operserv clonerule set *@foo.com flags ignore kill

^PAGE:operserv ptrigger
This page documents the creation of permanent triggers:
    Firstly, the 'rule' is created with:
        /msg operserv clonerule add <mask>
    The mask is of the form <user|*>@<hostmask>
    Then the trigger levels can be set using:
        /msg operserv clonerule set <rule> HTRIGGER <value>
        /msg operserv clonerule set <rule> UTRIGGER <value>
    If you set the value for HTRIGGER, then that will be the host-level
    trigger for all u@hosts matching rule: meaning, only <value> clients may
    signon from that host before firing the clones action or warning.
    If you set the value for UTRIGGER, then that will be the user-level
    trigger for all u@hosts matching the rule.
    As a general rule, don't set UTRIGGER unless a username is contained
    in the mask, and NEVER change the HTRIGGER or flags unless a hostname
    is contained in the mask.
    Other issues regarding the CLONERULE command will be placed in this 
    file.
