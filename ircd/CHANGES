	* Removed ident from ircd - complete code removal will be done by
	  next version.

	* Some ancient unneeded compatibility removed

Wed Apr 27 16:32:57 PDT 1999 - Mysidia
	* 'OPMODE' command allow opers with 'M' flag to hack channel modes
	* changed ircd logging mechanism, now uses tolog() function instead
	  of calling open() and write() within the function that needs to log something
	* took out the remains of /summon and /users

Fri Jul 31 23:17:24 CDT 1998 - Mysidia
	* detect open socks servers
	* fixed /stats o display, eliminate use of yicky macros is_globo() and is_loco()
	* re-organized struct.h, added some more bit macros, and grouped
	  those that modify a single flag
	* cptr->hurt == 2 is now another permanent hurt id#, one in which
	  the user receives the socks notification instead of the normal hurt notification.
	* show hurt status in /whois
	* added check_hurt() to deal with expiring hurts of acptr
	* bugfix in m_private() that let non-hurt users /msg hurt users
	* when /hurt users are in hurt type 2 they can /msg opers and services
	* fixed a (bug?) in the code that sets 'UFLAG' on connect, it was 
	  using sptr->flags |= (UFLAGS & atoi(host)) for some strange reason...
	  also removed the usermodes +i and +s from UFLAGS...
	* changed every reference to sptr->flags or cptr->flags
	  to ClientFlags() and ClientUmode() this is so umodes can be stored
	  in a different variable if we run out of flags
	* connect-time notices
	* sendto_umode()
	* sendto_umode_norep() == send something (like an open socks message)

Wed Apr 15 20:05:04 PDT 1998 - Cabal95

	  o If I:Lines do not contain an @, ident checking is not done and
	    no ~ prefix is used for the userid.
	  o If a C or N line contains an @, then ident checks are done
	    and only the username before the @ is accepted. If not @ is
	    provided no ident checking is done at all.

	* Prohibit most commands beforeregistration complete.

Fri Nov 29 04:16:15 1996  Michael Graff  <Michael Graff <explorer@flame.org>>

	* Changes for 3.2.6:

	* Make it almost unnecessary to edit the Makefile or include/config.h
	anymore.  Config now asks questions, and stores the answers in
	a file called Options.  The theory is this file can be copied into
	a new version and pathnames and other options will get defaults
	from it.

	* Make nospoof code optional.  Many servers do NOT need it, and
	some clients break badly with it.  Thank you, Netscrape...

Changes for 3.2.5
Sun Nov 24 04:39:57 1996  Michael Graff <explorer@flame.org>
	* Remove 2-second client connect delay.

Changes with 2.8.21.mu3.dal4 (Russell - Russell@dal.net)

* Added new user mode "g" that does the following:
	*notices all +og users with failed and/or succesful oper attempts 
	on all servers
	*notices all +og users with failed server connection attempts
	*moves miscellanous other things anyone can see.
* RAKILL command that allows ulined servers to remove an autokill as 
	easily as it adds one.
* Added support for temporary klines.
* defined new A: class of klines (for autokill).  These are meant to
	be services managed.
* UNKLINE command allowing opers to remove k:lines by address.

* Hacked STATS K to distinguish between permanent and temporary klines.
* GOPER command allows a ulined client to broadcast all opers whether or not
        any other flags are enabled.
* GLOBOPS command allows opers to broadcast over GLOBAL messages, thereby 
	depreciating wallops.  Wallops behavior stays the same though.
* patch to allow the proper propagation of autokills.
* Masks server notices that show PRIVMSGs
* Masks the password from the failed oper attempt messages
* Removed those annoying NET.RIDE and HACK notices

  TOPICs are now incompatible with versions prior to dal2]

* Added a STATS X function that shows what C lines are not currently
  active (i.e. missing servers)
* Will now WALLOP all +w users when a server connects or disconnects
  from the network
* Added AKILL command, which allows U lined servers to establish
  temporary global K lines.
* New KLINE command; operators can now temporarily add K lines to
  the server
* Fixed a missing feature (bug?) where you could change nicks while banned
  if the channel was moderated. Side effect of this fix is that noone
  can now change nicks when banned, even chanops.
* NOTE is gone for good. May it rest in peace.
* Tidied up STATS K to work with spaces in the comment field (it turns the
  field into a * if there are spaces), so you can use ircii's /stats k
  handler as well as spaces.
