Fri Nov 29 04:16:15 1996  Michael Graff  <Michael Graff <explorer@flame.org>>

	* Changes for 3.2.6:

	* Make it almost unnecessary to edit the Makefile or include/config.h
	anymore.  Config now asks questions, and stores the answers in
	a file called Options.  The theory is this file can be copied into
	a new version and pathnames and other options will get defaults
	from it.

	* Make nospoof code optional.  Many servers do NOT need it, and
	some clients break badly with it.  Thank you, Netscrape...

Changes for 3.2.5
Sun Nov 24 04:39:57 1996  Michael Graff <explorer@flame.org>
	* Remove 2-second client connect delay.

Changes with 2.8.21.mu3.dal4 (Russell - Russell@dal.net)

* Added new user mode "g" that does the following:
	*notices all +og users with failed and/or succesful oper attempts 
	on all servers
	*notices all +og users with failed server connection attempts
	*moves miscellanous other things anyone can see.
* RAKILL command that allows ulined servers to remove an autokill as 
	easily as it adds one.

* GOPER command allows a ulined client to broadcast all opers whether or not
        any other flags are enabled.

	depreciating wallops.  Wallops behavior stays the same though.

* Added a STATS X function that shows what C lines are not currently
  active (i.e. missing servers)
* Will now WALLOP all +w users when a server connects or disconnects
  from the network
* Added AKILL command, which allows U lined servers to establish
  temporary global K lines.
* New KLINE command; operators can now temporarily add K lines to
  the server
* Fixed a missing feature (bug?) where you could change nicks while banned
  if the channel was moderated. Side effect of this fix is that noone
  can now change nicks when banned, even chanops.
* NOTE is gone for good. May it rest in peace.
* Tidied up STATS K to work with spaces in the comment field (it turns the
  field into a * if there are spaces), so you can use ircii's /stats k
