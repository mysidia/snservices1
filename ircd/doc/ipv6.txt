To represent an ipv6 address in ircd.conf, place the address between
angle brackets: '<' and '>'.

For example: <0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1> 

To additionally listen on port 9000 of an ipv6 interface,
the following might be used:

P:<1234:456:7:89a:bcd:ef0:1234:567>:*:*:9000

Or to make ipv6 the primary interface:

M:astral-test.sorcery.net:<1234:456:7:89a:bcd:ef0:1234:567>:Foo Server:9000

For a Z-line:

Z:<0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1>:Please don't log on from the local machine:*
