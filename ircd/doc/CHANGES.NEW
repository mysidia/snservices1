CHANGED BEHAVIOUR IN ircd-sor1.3.5
*********************************************************************

Configuration:
 * New ircd configuration line: W-line, enhanced K-line for banning by
   information supplied in the USER line, usage:

   W:[host]:[reason]:[nickname]:[username]:[sup user]:[sup server]:[real name]
        ^       ^        ^          ^          ^           ^           ^
      host   passwd     name     string4     string5     string6    string7

   For example:
       W::Blah blah:::::Forbidden Realname

Networking:
 * IPv6 support
 * NXDOMAIN DNS replies are now handled correctly. (no longer wait for timeout)

Modes:
 * +o users are allowed to send commands at full speed.
 * +g/+s are restricted to opers.
 * New +r/+R and +v/+V usermodes, new /whois entry.
 * New ban types RR and RV. (require registered, require validated)

Others:
 * Back to version check of 1.3.4_1, with option to not reject clients without
   reply. (define REQ_VERSION_RESPONSE to reject clients without version reply,
   or NO_VERSION_CHECK to skip the whole check)
 * Supplied client version is shown in whois reply.
 * Don't allow \033, \037, \026, \017, \b, \t, \003, \002, \001, or \240
   in channel names anymore.
 * Default NS_URL has changed because of the new website.
